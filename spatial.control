! Change 'Spatial?' from 'No' to 'Yes' to read in .anomalies file for the given variable,
!  and make that variable spatially-varying in the clim or param file
! Note that Col=0 -> parameter, Col>0 -> climate variable
!  (in the latter case, Col gives the column # in the .clim file - indexing is such that col. 0 would be loc)
